# cs231 Spring 2017 

Notes to help me understand and complete [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) Spring 2017 assignments. This repo does not have any completed assignments.

### Notebook nbviewer Link
The notebook looks and works the best on nbviewer:
- [cs231n-two-layer-backprop-math.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/g-eoj/deep-learning-notebooks/blob/master/cs231n-two-layer-backprop-math.ipynb)

### Setup
The conda environment I used to complete the assignments can be recreated with `cs231n-conda-env.txt`.
