# Deep Learning Notebooks

Collection of notebooks I made on deep learning topics. Most of the notebooks look and work the best on 
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), however nbviewer doesn't support interactivity.

#### nbviewer links:
- [cs231n Two-Layer Backprop Mathematics Example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/g-eoj/deep-learning-notebooks/blob/master/cs231n-two-layer-backprop-math.ipynb)
  (based on Stanford CS231n Spring 2017 [Assignment 1](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2017/assignment1/) Q4)
- [Dropout Visualization for 2D Convolution Layers](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/g-eoj/deep-learning-notebooks/blob/master/2d-conv-dropout-visualization.ipynb)
- [Dropout Proportion z-Tests](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/g-eoj/deep-learning-notebooks/blob/master/dropout-proportion-z-tests.ipynb)
- [SGD Update Visualization for Single Parameter](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/g-eoj/deep-learning-notebooks/blob/master/sgd-update-visualization.ipynb)
  (interactivity not available on nbviewer)
